# Prophecy examples

The project shows how to use [Prophecy](http://github.com/phpspec/prophecy) features along with PHPUnit.
The examples you can find in the tests emphasize usage of Test Doubles:

* Dummy
* Stub
* Mock
* Spy

The code is inspired by:
* [Mocking demystified](http://www.slideshare.net/marcello.duarte/mocking-demystified)
